As with all NBME invested funds, the Finance Committee monitors performance and recommends to the Executive Board any changes to the principal balance of the Fund.THE STRATEGIC EDUCATOR ENHANCEMENT FUND OF NBMEIn 2017, NBME established the Strategic Educator Enhancement Fund to provide opportunities of value to the community from which NBME obtains volunteers and other stakeholders.

The maximum annual authorized disbursement from the quasi-endowment fund for 2017 through 2019 is an average of $600,000 per year.

The ACP provides comprehensive objective and personalized assessments of physicians for whom there is a question regarding clinical competence. Together, the PLAS programs have assessed thousands of physicians over the past decade for reasons that range from endorsement of licensure to license reactivation after disciplinary action.Research and Discovery programs include the Center for Innovation, the Office of Research, and Product Discovery. This unit also oversees the Stemmler Medical Education Research Fund. The Center for Innovation serves as a portal to possible NBME futures by exploring concepts that could disrupt or otherwise affect the NBMEs future and by assimilating and communicating their implications. The Office of Research supports the NBMEs research enterprise by promoting a scholarly environment, coordinating the NBMEs research efforts across the organization, and ensuring that the NBMEs research portfolio is consistent with institutional priorities. The Product Discovery sub-unit oversees the generation of new ideas and their progression through concept development, prototyping, and business model development to create a portfolio of new products designed to meet the NBMEs diversification objectives. The Stemmler Medical Education Research Fund assists research in topics relevant to the mission of NBME and has supported 85 grant awards for a total of approximately $8 million since 1995. In addition to these defined programs of research and development, each program area and service unit is charged to carry on a program of research and development relevant to the work of the program or unit, for example, development of new item formats for USMLE, exploring relationships between prior measures and certifying exam performance for our clients and developing new testing methods for clients. These research and development activities result in the publication of dozens of research reports in scientific journals and presentations at scientific meetings each year.In aggregate, these programs deliver information vital for planning business strategy related to future assessment; and support conception and market testing of products ideas, and the research to investigate and sustain products.The Center for Advanced Assessment (CAA) is responsible for conducting research related to improving the quality and efficiency of NBME products, services, and procedures.
