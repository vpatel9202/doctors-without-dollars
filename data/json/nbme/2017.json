PLAS comprises two programs: the Special Purpose Examination (SPEX) Program and the Assessment Center Program (ACP). SPEX is a one-day, multiple-choice examination of current knowledge requisite for the general, undifferentiated practice of medicine and is intended to be used for reasons of endorsement or reciprocity of licensure. The ACP provides comprehensive objective and personalized assessments of physicians for whom there is a question regarding clinical competence. Together, the PLAS programs have assessed thousands of physicians over the past decade for reasons that range from endorsement of licensure to license reactivation after disciplinary action.Research and Development Programs include the Center for Innovation and the Office of Research, which administers the Stemmler Medical Education Research Fund. The Center for Innovation is charged with development of new products and services and exploration of new ventures that facilitate NBME's strategic vision and mission. The Stemmler Medical Education Research Fund assists research in topics relevant to the mission of NBME and has supported 82 grant awards for a total of over $7.5 million since 1995. In addition to these defined programs of research and development, each program area and service unit is charged to carry on a program of research and development relevant to the work of the program or unit, for example, development of new item formats for USMLE, exploring relationships between prior measures and certifying exam performance for our clients and developing new testing methods for clients. These research and development activities result in the publication of dozens of research reports in scientific journals and presentations at scientific meetings each year.NBME U is an evidence-based set of 28 online lessons designed to help health professions educators create reliable, high-quality assessments to evaluate student knowledge and skills. The latest version of NBME U, launched in 2016, was enhanced through development of a more robust learning platform, awarding 0.25 AMA PR Category I credits for physician learners, and a certificate of participation for other health professions educators.In aggregate, these programs deliver information vital for planning business strategy related to future assessment; and support conception and market testing of products ideas, and the research to investigate and sustain products. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 5: NBME's International Programs unit provides students, graduate physicians, medical schools, and regulatory agencies with valid and reliable information regarding individual knowledge and overall curriculum effectiveness. The International Foundations of Medicine (IFOM) examinations represent a key component of NBME International Programs. The Clinical Science Examination (CSE) covers the core of clinical knowledge in medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and psychiatry expected of students in the final year of undergraduate medical education. The Basic Science Examination (BSE) incorporates the common core of knowledge expected of students who have completed the preclinical curriculum and are about to begin study of clinical medicine. In 2016, over 5,000 candidates sat for the IFOM CSE. The NBME International Programs unit also offers a portfolio of consultative, faculty and institutional development, and assessment programs in the international undergraduate medical education, certification and licensure, and graduate medical education environments. Consultative services often include an on-site evaluation of the overall assessment capability for medical schools.
