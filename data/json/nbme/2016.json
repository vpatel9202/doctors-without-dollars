PLAS comprises two programs: the Special Purpose Examination (SPEX) Program and the Assessment Center Program (ACP). SPEX is a one-day, multiple-choice examination of current knowledge requisite for the general, undifferentiated practice of medicine and is intended to be used for reasons of endorsement or reciprocity of licensure. The ACP provides comprehensive objective and personalized assessments of physicians for whom there is a question regarding clinical competence. Together, the PLAS programs have assessed thousands of physicians over the past decade for reasons that range from endorsement of licensure to license reactivation after disciplinary action.Research and Discovery programs include the Center for Innovation, Product Discovery, and the Office of Research, which administers the Stemmler Medical Education Research Fund. The Center for Innovation is charged with exploration of events and trends that have implications for NBME's future assessments. Product Discovery provides an internal service focused on development of a pipeline of potential products to advance the organizations mission and vision. The Office of Research supports the research enterprise, distributed throughout the organization, in ensuring alignment of research with strategic priorities. The Stemmler Medical Education Research Fund supports innovations in assessment in US and Canadian medical schools and has awarded 80 grants for a total of over $7.1 million since 1995. In aggregate, these programs deliver information vital for planning business strategy related to future assessment; and support conception and market testing of products ideas, and the research to investigate and sustain products. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 5: NBME's International Programs unit provides students, graduate physicians, medical schools, and regulatory agencies with valid and reliable information regarding individual knowledge and overall curriculum effectiveness. The International Foundations of Medicine (IFOM) examinations represent a key component of NBME International Programs. The Clinical Science Examination (CSE) covers the core of clinical knowledge in medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and psychiatry expected of students in the final year of undergraduate medical education. The Basic Science Examination (BSE) incorporates the common core of knowledge expected of students who have completed the preclinical curriculum and are about to begin study of clinical medicine. In 2015, approximately 4,400 candidates sat for the IFOM CSE. The NBME International Programs unit also offers a portfolio of consultative, faculty and institutional development, and assessment programs in the international undergraduate medical education, certification and licensure, and graduate medical education environments. Consultative services often include an on-site evaluation of the overall assessment capability for medical schools. The International Programs unit is also involved in various research projects related to the validity and reliability of various assessment tools.Note: The expenses reflected above do not include institutional indirect expenses."}, {"FormAndLineReferenceDesc": "Form 990, Part VI, Line 6: Explanation of Classes of Members or Shareholder", "ExplanationTxt": "The members of the NBME are responsible for electing its board of directors, the Executive Board, recommending policy for the organization proposed by the Executive Board, receiving reports on the annual budget, and approving amendments to the by-laws of the organization.
