The initial sum of $5,000,000 was invested and professionally managed with the goal of maintaining the corpus of the Fund over time while providing total annual grants up to 5% of the trailing three-year average of the fund balance. As with all NBME invested funds, the Finance Committee monitors performance and recommends to the Executive Board any changes to the principal balance of the Fund.THE STRATEGIC EDUCATOR ENHANCEMENT FUNDIn 2017, NBME established the Strategic Educator Enhancement Fund to foster professional development for its community of volunteers and other stakeholders. The initial amount of $20,000,000 was designated within NBMEs investments as a quasi-endowment fund. The maximum annual authorized disbursement from the quasi-endowment fund for 2017 through 2019 is an average of $600,000 per year.

Accordingly, NBME had net operating loss carryforwards of $1,464,000 and a related deferred tax asset of $307,000 as of December 31, 2017, which was fully reserved due to the uncertainty of the realization of the loss. Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 enacted new provisions in the IRC that subject amounts paid or incurred by employers to provide qualified transportation fringe benefits to employees to unrelated business income tax. Accordingly, NBME reversed the beginning-of-the-year deferred tax asset reserve of $307,000 and recognized an $110,000 unrelated business income tax charge associated with UBTI of $525,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.

PLAS comprises two programs: the Special Purpose Examination (SPEX) Program and the Assessment Center Program (ACP). SPEX is a one-day, multiple-choice examination of current knowledge requisite for the general, undifferentiated practice of medicine and is intended to be used for reasons of endorsement or reciprocity of licensure. The ACP provides comprehensive objective and personalized assessments of physicians for whom there is a question regarding clinical competence. Together, the PLAS programs have assessed thousands of physicians over the past decade for reasons that range from endorsement of licensure to license reactivation after disciplinary action.Research and Discovery programs include the Office of Research and Product Discovery. This unit also oversees the Stemmler Medical Education Research Fund. The Office of Research supports the NBMEs research enterprise by coordinating the NBMEs research efforts across the organization and ensuring that the NBMEs research portfolio is consistent with institutional priorities. The Product Discovery sub-unit oversees the generation of new ideas and their progression through concept development, prototyping, and business model development to create a portfolio of new products designed to meet the NBMEs diversification objectives. The Stemmler Medical Education Research Fund assists research in topics relevant to the mission of NBME and has supported almost 90 grant awards for a total of approximately $8.25 million since 1995. In addition to these defined programs of research and development, each program area and service unit is charged to carry on a program of research and development relevant to the work of the program or unit, for example, development of new item formats for USMLE, exploring relationships between prior measures and certifying exam performance for our clients and developing new testing methods for clients. These research and development activities result in the publication of dozens of research reports in scientific journals and presentations at scientific meetings each year.In aggregate, these programs deliver information vital for planning strategy related to innovative assessments to meet stakeholder needs. They support conception and market testing of product ideas and the research to investigate and sustain products and services.The Center for Advanced Assessment (CAA) is responsible for conducting research related to improving the quality and efficiency of NBME products, services, and procedures. It is also aimed at developing capabilities that allow the NBME to expand its range of assessments both geographically and across the health professions. In addition to this work, the CAA provides non-routine technical support to other organizational divisions and subunits and conducts research to contribute to the field of measurement.The North American Veterinary Licensing Examination (NAVLE), co-sponsored and co-owned by the International Council for Veterinary Assessment (ICVA) and the NBME, is a requirement for licensure to practice veterinary medicine in all licensing jurisdictions in North America. From 1998 until 2014, NAVLE development was governed by a series of contracts between the ICVA and the NBME. In February 2014, the ICVA entered into a collaborative relationship with the NBME with regard to the NAVLE. Under the collaboration, the NAVLE is overseen by the Collaboration for Veterinary Assessments (CVA) Governance Committee, comprising members appointed by the ICVA and the NBME. The purpose of the collaboration is to increase efficiency and facilitate NAVLE enhancements, drawing on the best of both organizations.The Health & Wellness Coach Certifying Examination is a collaborative program with the International Consortium of Health & Wellness Coaching. This new exam program is designed to assess competence in the field of health and wellness coaching. To date, over 1,800 health and wellness coaches have passed the certifying exam. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 5: NBME's International Programs unit provides students, graduate physicians, medical schools, and regulatory agencies with valid and reliable information regarding individual knowledge and overall curriculum effectiveness. The International Foundations of Medicine (IFOM) examinations represent a key component of NBME International Programs. The Clinical Science Examination (CSE) covers the core of clinical knowledge in medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and psychiatry expected of students in the final year of undergraduate medical education. The Basic Science Examination (BSE) incorporates the common core of knowledge expected of students who have completed the preclinical curriculum and are about to begin study of clinical medicine. The NBME International Programs unit also offers a portfolio of consultative, faculty and institutional development, and assessment programs in the international undergraduate medical education, certification and licensure, and graduate medical education environments. Consultative services often include an on-site evaluation of the overall assessment capability for medical schools.
