STEMMLER, MD MEDICAL EDUCATION RESEARCH FUNDOF THE NATIONAL BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS (NBME)PurposeThe purpose of the Stemmler Fund is to provide support for research or development of innovative evaluation methodology or techniques, with the potential to advance assessment in medical education or practice at eligible medical schools.2013-2014 Goal: The goal of the Stemmler Fund's 2013-2014 Call for Letters of Intent is to provide support, through a program of annual grants, for research or development of innovative assessment approaches that will enhance the evaluation of those preparing to, or continuing to, practice medicine. Expected outcomes include advances in the theory, knowledge, or practice of assessment at any point along the continuum of medical education, from undergraduate and graduate education and training, through clinical practice. Pilot and more comprehensive projects are both of interest. Collaborative investigations within or among institutions are not only eligible but encouraged, particularly as they strengthen the likelihood of the project's overall contribution and success.Eligibility: The eligible applicants for Stemmler Fund grant awards are the medical schools accredited by the LCME or the AOA. Additional eligibility requirements include:- The number of Letters of Intent submitted by any eligible school is not limited. However, an individual may not be principal investigator on more than one Letter of Intent. The designated principal investigator must represent the primary applicant institution and must be responsible for project oversight and reporting. (The applicant institution's rules apply regarding eligibility of their faculty, staff, or associates to serve as investigators.)- A maximum of two applications representing a revised Letter of Intent previously submitted to the Fund program will be accepted by the NBME. That is, applications addressing the same substantive study topic by the same investigators may be submitted for Fund consideration no more than a total of three times.- The primary investigators of prior Fund grants are eligible to reapply and compete (with new applicants) for one additional award through the Stemmler Fund Call for Letters of Intent for the same line of study. Current award recipients are eligible to compete again only if any current NBME support is expected to terminate satisfactorily by the beginning of the 2013-2014 project period (usually July 1, 2014).Selection Process:1. All submitted Letters of Intent will be reviewed by NBME staff to ensure eligibility and completeness.2. The Stemmler Fund Steering Committee will then evaluate Letters of Intent on the extent to which the proposed research is innovative or will advance assessment in medical education or practice, and addresses an important problem or issue in medical education or practice.3. The Stemmler Fund Steering Committee will then meet to select a subset of Letters of Intent (e.g., 10-15) and invite the principal investigators to submit full proposals.4. All Invited Proposals will be reviewed by NBME staff to ensure completeness.5. Peer reviewers with expertise in measurement, research design and methodology will then evaluate Invited Proposals on the relevance and significance of the proposal to the purpose and goals of the Stemmler Fund, the adequacy of the research design or methodology, and the qualifications of the principal investigator and project staff.6. The Stemmler Fund Steering Committee will then review all proposals and peer reviews, giving careful consideration to the adequacy of the budget, timetable, and other key project resources in each proposal, and select awardees. The NBME will provide feedback detailing the comments provided by reviewers of applications not selected for funding.Grant Fund Use Monitoring:Grant recipients are required to submit an interim and final report which includes a Final Project Narrative and a Final Project Fiscal Report."}]}, "IRS990ScheduleJ": {"@documentId": "IRS990ScheduleJ", "@softwareId": "13000170", "@softwareVersion":

PLAS comprises two programs: the Special Purpose Examination (SPEX) Program and the Assessment Center Program (ACP). SPEX is a one-day, multiple-choice examination of current knowledge requisite for the general, undifferentiated practice of medicine and is intended to be used for reasons of endorsement or reciprocity of licensure. The ACP provides comprehensive objective and personalized assessments of physicians for whom there is a question regarding clinical competence. Together, the PLAS programs have assessed thousands of physicians over the past decade for reasons that range from endorsement of licensure to license reactivation after disciplinary action.In 2012, the Assessment of Professional Behaviors (APB) multisource feedback program was rebranded as the Observational Assessment (OA) team to better reflect NBMEs work in multiple domains. In 2013, the OA team collaborated with the Association of Pediatric Program Directors to study the feasibility of using a subset of pediatric competencies (and the associated milestones) to assess the readiness of fourth-year medical students and pediatric interns to serve in the inpatient setting. New assessment tools were employed using multisource feedback based on both immediate observation of learners and on cumulative observation over days and weeks, with participating pediatric residency training programs. By mid-2013, 97 learners had been assessed. Research and Development Programs include the Center for Innovation and the Stemmler Medical Education Research Fund. The Center for Innovation is charged with development of new products and services and exploration of new ventures that facilitate NBME's strategic vision and mission. The Stemmler Medical Education Research Fund assists research in topics relevant to the mission of NBME and has supported 74 grant awards for a total of over $6.2 million since 1995. In addition to these defined programs of research and development, each program area and service unit is charged to carry on a program of research and development relevant to the work of the program or unit, for example, development of new item formats for USMLE, exploring relationships between prior measures and certifying exam performance for our clients and developing new testing methods for clients. These research and development activities result in the publication of dozens of research reports in scientific journals and presentations at scientific meetings each year.Note: The expenses reflected above do not include institutional indirect expenses. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 5: NBME's International Programs unit provides students, graduate physicians, medical schools, and regulatory agencies with valid and reliable information regarding individual knowledge and overall curriculum effectiveness. The International Foundations of Medicine (IFOM) examinations represent a key component of NBME International Programs. The Clinical Science Examination (CSE) covers the core of clinical knowledge in medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and psychiatry expected of students in the final year of undergraduate medical education. The Basic Science Examination (BSE) incorporates the common core of knowledge expected of students who have completed the preclinical curriculum and are about to begin study of clinical medicine. In 2013, approximately 3,000 candidates sat for the IFOM CSE. The NBME International Programs unit also offers a portfolio of consultative, faculty and institutional development, and assessment programs in the international undergraduate medical education, certification and licensure, and graduate medical education environments. Consultative services often include an on-site evaluation of the overall assessment capability for medical schools. The International Programs unit is also involved in various research projects related to the validity and reliability of various assessment tools.Note: The expenses reflected above do not include institutional indirect expenses.
