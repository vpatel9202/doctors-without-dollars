STEMMLER, MD MEDICAL EDUCATION RESEARCH FUNDOF THE NATIONAL BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS (NBME)PurposeThe purpose of the Stemmler Fund is to provide support for research or development of innovative evaluation methodology or techniques, with the potential to advance assessment in medical education or practice at eligible medical schools.2014-2015 Goal: The goal of the Stemmler Fund's 2014-2015 Call for Letters of Intent is to provide support, through a program of annual grants, for research or development of innovative assessment approaches that will enhance the evaluation of those preparing to, or continuing to, practice medicine. Expected outcomes include advances in the theory, knowledge, or practice of assessment at any point along the continuum of medical education, from undergraduate and graduate education and training, through clinical practice. Pilot and more comprehensive projects are both of interest. Collaborative investigations within or among institutions are not only eligible but encouraged, particularly as they strengthen the likelihood of the project's overall contribution and success.Eligibility: The eligible applicants for Stemmler Fund grant awards are the medical schools accredited by the LCME or the AOA. Additional eligibility requirements include:- The number of Letters of Intent submitted by any eligible school is not limited. However, an individual may not be principal investigator on more than one Letter of Intent. The designated principal investigator must represent the primary applicant institution and must be responsible for project oversight and reporting. (The applicant institution's rules apply regarding eligibility of their faculty, staff, or associates to serve as investigators.)- A maximum of two applications representing a revised Letter of Intent previously submitted to the Fund program will be accepted by the NBME. That is, applications addressing the same substantive study topic by the same investigators may be submitted for Fund consideration no more than a total of three times.- The primary investigators of prior Fund grants are eligible to reapply and compete (with new applicants) for one additional award through the Stemmler Fund Call for Letters of Intent for the same line of study. Current award recipients are eligible to compete again only if any current NBME support is expected to terminate satisfactorily by the beginning of the 2014-2015 project period (usually July 1, 2015).Selection Process:1. All submitted Letters of Intent will be reviewed by NBME staff to ensure eligibility and completeness.2. The Stemmler Fund Steering Committee will then evaluate Letters of Intent on the extent to which the proposed research is innovative or will advance assessment in medical education or practice, and addresses an important problem or issue in medical education or practice.3. The Stemmler Fund Steering Committee will then meet to select a subset of Letters of Intent (e.g., 10-15) and invite the principal investigators to submit full proposals.4. All Invited Proposals will be reviewed by NBME staff to ensure completeness.5. Peer reviewers with expertise in measurement, research design and methodology will then evaluate Invited Proposals on the relevance and significance of the proposal to the purpose and goals of the Stemmler Fund, the adequacy of the research design or methodology, and the qualifications of the principal investigator and project staff.6. The Stemmler Fund Steering Committee will then review all proposals and peer reviews, giving careful consideration to the adequacy of the budget, timetable, and other key project resources in each proposal, and select awardees. The NBME will provide feedback detailing the comments provided by reviewers of applications not selected for funding.Grant Fund Use Monitoring:Grant recipients are required to submit an interim and final report which includes a Final Project Narrative and a Final Project Fiscal Report."}]}, "IRS990ScheduleJ": {"@documentId": "IRS990ScheduleJ", "@softwareId": "14000265", "@softwareVersionNum": "2014v5.0", "FirstClassOrCharterTravelInd": "X", "TravelForCompanionsInd": "X", "IdemnificationGrossUpPmtsInd": "X", "ClubDuesOrFeesInd": "X", "WrittenPolicyRefTAndEExpnssInd": "true", "SubstantiationRequiredInd": "true", "CompensationCommitteeInd": "X", "IndependentConsultantInd": "X", "Form990OfOtherOrganizationsInd": "X", "WrittenEmploymentContractInd": "X", "CompensationSurveyInd": "X", "BoardOrCommitteeApprovalInd": "X", "SeverancePaymentInd": "false", "SupplementalNonqualRtrPlanInd": "true", "EquityBasedCompArrngmInd": "false", "CompBasedOnRevenueOfFlngOrgInd": "false", "CompBsdOnRevRelatedOrgsInd": "false", "CompBsdNetEarnsFlngOrgInd": "false", "CompBsdNetEarnsRltdOrgsInd": "false", "AnyNonFixedPaymentsInd": "false", "InitialContractExceptionInd": "false", "RebuttablePresumptionProcInd": "false", "RltdOrgOfficerTrstKeyEmplGrp": [{"PersonNm": "Agata P Butler", "TitleTxt": "VP, Med Ed & Health Prof Svcs", "BaseCompensationFilingOrgAmt": "236618", "OtherCompensationFilingOrgAmt": "-1141", "DeferredCompensationFlngOrgAmt": "89859", "NontaxableBenefitsFilingOrgAmt": "23973", "TotalCompensationFilingOrgAmt": "349309"}, {"PersonNm": "Brian E Clauser", "TitleTxt": "VP, Meas.

PLAS comprises two programs: the Special Purpose Examination (SPEX) Program and the Assessment Center Program (ACP). SPEX is a one-day, multiple-choice examination of current knowledge requisite for the general, undifferentiated practice of medicine and is intended to be used for reasons of endorsement or reciprocity of licensure. The ACP provides comprehensive objective and personalized assessments of physicians for whom there is a question regarding clinical competence. Together, the PLAS programs have assessed thousands of physicians over the past decade for reasons that range from endorsement of licensure to license reactivation after disciplinary action.Research and Discovery programs include the Center for Innovation, Product Discovery, and the Office of Research, which administers the Stemmler Medical Education Research Fund. The Center for Innovation is charged with exploration of events and trends that have implications for NBME's future assessments. Product Discovery provides an internal service focused on development of a pipeline of potential products to advance the organizations vision. The Office of Research supports the research enterprise, distributed throughout the organization, in ensuring alignment of research with strategic priorities. The Stemmler Medical Education Research Fund supports innovations in assessment in US and Canadian medical schools and has awarded 77 grants for a total of over $6.7 million since 1995. In aggregate, these programs deliver information vital for planning business strategy related to future assessment; and support conception and market testing of products ideas, and the research to investigate and sustain products.Note: The expenses reflected above do not include institutional indirect expenses. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 5: NBME's International Programs unit provides students, graduate physicians, medical schools, and regulatory agencies with valid and reliable information regarding individual knowledge and overall curriculum effectiveness. The International Foundations of Medicine (IFOM) examinations represent a key component of NBME International Programs. The Clinical Science Examination (CSE) covers the core of clinical knowledge in medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and psychiatry expected of students in the final year of undergraduate medical education. The Basic Science Examination (BSE) incorporates the common core of knowledge expected of students who have completed the preclinical curriculum and are about to begin study of clinical medicine. In 2014, approximately 4,200 candidates sat for the IFOM CSE. The NBME International Programs unit also offers a portfolio of consultative, faculty and institutional development, and assessment programs in the international undergraduate medical education, certification and licensure, and graduate medical education environments. Consultative services often include an on-site evaluation of the overall assessment capability for medical schools. The International Programs unit is also involved in various research projects related to the validity and reliability of various assessment tools.Note: The expenses reflected above do not include institutional indirect expenses."}, {"FormAndLineReferenceDesc": "Form 990, Part VI, Line 6: Explanation of Classes of Members or Shareholder", "ExplanationTxt": "The members of the NBME are responsible for electing its board of directors, the Executive Board, recommending policy for the organization proposed by the Executive Board, receiving reports on the annual budget, and approving amendments to the by-laws of the organization.
